     <Data><![CDATA[<p>Merscythe smiled with satisfaction as the lock clicked into place and the door quietly hissed open. He and Herv stepped into the ship and entered a long, dark corridor. They tiptoed cautiously past many doors toward the cockpit of the ship.</p><p>“Maybe we should check each of these rooms,” whispered Merscythe.</p><p>“No,” said Herv, “there’s no time to waste. We need to fly the ship straight toward the lava pit. And there’s no need to whisper,” he added. “Ari and her henchmen are miles away.”</p><p>“Can you fly the ship?” asked Merscythe.</p><p>“Nope, I’ve never flown anything before.”</p><p>“Wait, then how will we get there?”</p><p>“Don’t worry! We’ll figure something out,” replied Herv, not very reassuringly.</p><p>They rounded a corner and bumped into an ugly gnome with a large head. Before they could react, he pounced on Merscythe and Herv and knocked their heads together hard.</p><p>“Oof,” mumbled Merscythe before blacking out.</p><p>Merscythe awoke to found himself strapped to a chair. He was in a luxurious cockpit with gold-plated everything. There was a bubbly fountain in one corner, and airplane controls in front of the large tinted windows. It was beautiful in a menacing sort of </break>way. He tried getting up and got an electric shock for his trouble. He tried summoning green fire, and felt the same burst of energy flow through him. He hiccupped, wincing at the pain it caused him. Ari sat in a corner, watching him intently. There was a small crown on her head today. He glared at her and tried to think of a biting comment, but felt woozy and slumped back in the chair. She stood up and casually strutted up to him.</p><p>“Aha. I see you have awoken. I presume you recognize my beautifulness. I suppose I should explain myself. You see, there was a time when we elves and gnomes were masters of the land. We were powerful and mighty. There were humans, but they were nowhere near as cruel and evil as they are today. Finally, the humans grew angry at us for reasons unknown. There were three wizards, Mertis, the clever, Merscythe, your namesake, and Merlin, the most powerful wizard to ever exist. He was much more powerful than you. They cast a spell that made us stay underground and never use a charm again. We are bereft of the powerful magic we had long ago.”</p><p>Herv was in the corner of the rectangular cockpit, trapped in a contraption similar to Merscythe’s. He groaned, and Merscythe noticed him for the first time. He looked terrible. He was chalk-white and covered with scrapes.</p></break><p>“Merscythe has more power than you will ever have,” Herv groaned.</p><p>Ari was extremely angry. Truthfully, she was worried about this human. He had some strong magical powers. Coolly, she turned to Herv and demanded, “What are you doing on my ship?” She turned back to Merscythe, her eyes flashing angrily. “And how did you get out of my lab? The only person who can go in and out is me.”</p><p>“I thought you were in prison,” said Herv.</p><p>“Sorry to disappoint you,” Ari replied, not sounding sorry at all. “But the UFOS will never catch me.”</p><p>“We’re looking for Loog.”</p><p>“Loog? What's happened to Loog?” Her face paled for an instant.</p><p>“We think that the UFOS have him. We need to get through the lava pit and find him,” said Herv.</p><p>“And what does that have to do with me?” asked Ari, clearly knowing the answer.</p><p>“Don’t you see? We’re on the same side now, fighting Verin. Loog will help you defeat him,” said Herv. “We need your ship.”</p><p>“Flying over the lava pit is impossible. The heat will destroy </break> the engines.”</p><p>Herv thought for a few minutes. “Merscythe's green fire.  It will cool the ship as it flies through the pit.”</p><p>Merscythe sat upright at the mention of his name. “Hey, wait—what makes you think I can conjure this up this stuff at will? I have no idea what happened in the lab the other day."</p><p>“I think we can solve that problem easily. We need your blood, human,” said Ari, smiling. She snapped her fingers. The two gnomes hurried into the room. The taller one was armed with a syringe again. Merscythe gawked at it. Yikes.</p><p>“Wait, you’ll get nothing from his blood,” Herv protested. “The spell is more powerful than he is. It will undo the magic in his blood.”</p><p>Ari turned around and looked proudly over her ship. “Genius,” she said aloud, as she called in her two insufferable gnomes: Reeli and Soupir Smart. “Smarties, take over the controls,” she ordered. “I’m too pretty to fly today.”</p><p>“AUGH!” yelled the brothers, ever charming.</p><p>Ari turned to Herv. “I have decided not to take the human’s blood,” she proclaimed haughtily. “Instead, we will rescue Loog using my brilliant ship and the human’s green fire.”</p><p>“I have a name, you know,” Merscythe mumbled.</p></break><p>Ari ignored him and continued. “After Loog is freed, we shall combine forces to depose Verin and reinstate me as the rightful queen of Apella, Loftar, and Miton.” Herv was about to disagree, but Ari was already addressing the brothers. “Follow the tracking signal. Try not to blow anything up. We don't want to draw attention to ourselves.”</p><p>“AUGH!” responded Reeli eloquently. He pressed a button, and the ship started rising into the air. He jerked the controls to the right and pressed another button. The ship spun around, and they saw the hangar door opening. Soupir pushed a handle forward, and the plane rocketed through the narrow opening, lightly scraping the bottom. Then, red lights appeared on the side of the cabin. “AUGHHH!” screeched Soupir, his eyes full of terror.</p><p>“What happened?!” screamed Reeli at Ari.</p><p>Ari was quite exhausted by these brothers' antics, so she shot each of them with a tranquilizer dart.</p><p>“Ow,” said the brothers in unison as they sank to the ground. Ari took over the controls herself.</p><p>“What’s with the flashing red lights?” Merscythe asked.</p><p>Ari pursed her lips before deciding to respond, “The transmissions antenna is damaged.”</p><p>“Is that going to be a problem?” asked Herv. Ari didn’t respond.</p><p>They hovered for a moment in the air, then she pounded the accelerator and they rocketed forward. Merscythe watched the buildings zoom by. The speed was tremendous, and everything was merely a blur. They kept going faster and faster. Merscythe was about to be sick. He tried to scoot forward, but couldn't. He craned his neck to look at the speedometer, but Ari swung the plane to the left and Merscythe's head crashed into the side window.</p><p>“Ow,” he groaned. He'd been saying that quite a lot lately. “Where are we heading? I can see the city quite clearly now.”</p><p>“This isn't some city tour, human. We’re going to the lava pit to rescue your friend Loog,” snapped Ari.</p><p>“We seem to be going around in circles,” said Herv. “Perhaps, for starters, if you could untie us, we may be able to help.”</p><p>Though Ari was reluctant to untie the pair, she grudgingly admitted that he had a point. By then, the Smarties had woken up from the effects of the dart. At the snap of Ari's fingers, they untied Herv and Merscythe and brought them to the front of the ship.</p><p>“There are UFOS everywhere,” Ari explained. “We can’t fly too fast, or we risk running into them. This ship is invisible, but not invincible.”</p> <p>Herv thought for a moment. “Merscythe, you can use the Codue to track the UFOS’ positions so that Ari can navigate her way to the lava pit.”</p><p>Ari swung around in astonishment. “Who gave you the Codue?” she asked Merscythe.</p><p>“My great-uncle,” he replied. “It's mine.” As he brought it out from his pocket, he noticed that orange light on top was flashing. He held it out to Ari, who was looking very interested. As she took it from him, he noticed that the light turned off. She returned it almost immediately.</p><p>“Good,” she said to him. "Now, track those UFOS."</p> ]]>
