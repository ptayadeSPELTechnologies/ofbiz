<p>Chapter 1: A Holey Reunion </p>
<p>Merscythe was just your typical, run of the mill 13-year-old. Fast forward to the present and he’s probably the least ordinary person in the world. Although he looks pretty normal with his soft, green eyes and black hair, he’s anything but ordinary. But before we get to all that, let’s go back to where this started—the sleepy town of Gobbler’s Knob, Pennsylvania.
Merscythe was at another boring family reunion. The tears, the “Oh, it’s been so long!”, and the hour-long talks about the old days was enough to drive him crazy. He’d rather get beaten up by Croy, the school bully (and he had experienced that a lot). He sat on a chair under a tree and avoided as many relatives as possible. He knew that they would find him and ask him what grade he was in, how old he was, what he liked to do, what he didn’t like to do, and a bunch of other questions that would bore him to death.
An old, bald man that Merscythe didn't recognize ambled up to him. "Merscythe? My, you've gotten big. Seems like yesterday you were just two feet tall!"
Merscythe groaned silently. The last thing he wanted was to speak to some family member. "Sorry, who are you?" he asked.
The man looked offended. "Well, I'm your Great-Uncle Gool, of course! Here, I brought you a gift." He reached into his pocket and handed Merscythe a dusty grey calculator with a huge screen. It looked even older than the man. "That's a Codue. They're really rare," he said proudly.
Can't imagine why, Merscythe thought, looking at the ancient device. Out loud, he said, "Thanks."
“Merscythe!” called someone, presumably his mother. “Aunt Arabella wants to talk to you! She’s come all the way from Massachusetts!”
Merscythe groaned again and ran away into the woods behind his home. As he ran, he tripped over a tree root and landed hard on his face. The Codue calculator tumbled out of his pocket. He moaned and rolled over. Reaching for the Codue, he saw that a small orange light was flashing on top. The device’s screen had powered on. The moment he picked it up, something strange happened. The entire tree flickered and suddenly, a dark green door appeared in the trunk. 
Merscythe was nonplussed. He put the calculator down and the door disappeared. He tried pointing the calculator at different trees, but nothing happened. Pushing himself up, he tried opening the door, but it was locked. As his hand brushed the tree, he realized that it didn’t feel like real wood—more like plastic. Glancing up, he realized that it had bright purple leaves that made no sound as they rustled. Looking closely at the Codue, Merscythe saw that its screen showed some words. He knelt down and read them aloud:
from Door import Door
treedoor = Door()
treedoor.close()
treedoor.close()
It appeared that the screen had some sort of program that referred to the door in the tree. Could it offer him a way in?
