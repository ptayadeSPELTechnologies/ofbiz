<Title>Practice Exercise 1-8: Using comments</Title>
<Data>A comment consists of text that is not part of the program but is used to explain the purpose of the program or a statement of code. It starts with the hash symbol # and extends to the end of the line.  It is a good programming practice to add meaningful comments to your program to make it easier to understand. In this exercise, insert two comments in the following program.

from Door import Door

treedoor = Door()
treedoor.close()
