<Title>Practice Exercise 3-12: Using the less than or equal to operator</Title>
<Data>
This type of condition is made up of two operators, a less than symbol followed by an equals sign. For example, to check if variable var1 is less than or equal to variable var2, you can write

var1 &lt;= var2

The variables temp1 and temp2 store two temperatures. Write a condition to check if temp1 is less than or equal to temp2.
