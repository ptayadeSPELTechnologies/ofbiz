To write the program, first use the print function to display the instructions for the game. Ask the friend to multiply his or her age by 10, add 2 to the resulting number, then multiply it by 10, subtract 13, and add their pocket change in cents to get a result. Next, use the input function prompt your friend to enter the result they got and read it into the program. Then subtract 7 from the result and divide it by 100.
